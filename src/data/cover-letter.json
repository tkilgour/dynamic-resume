  "Hello,",
  " ",
  "I am excited to apply for the Senior Software Developer, Front End role at Pixieset. With 6 years of professional experience as a Front End Developer and 4 years of experience with Vue.js, I believe that I am well-suited for this role.",
  "I have spent my career as a developer primarily working on client-focused projects with two different agencies. This has taught me how to collaborate with stakeholders and co-workers at all levels of the SDLC, and to grow my own skills in order to lead the direction of projects. For the last four years Vue.js has been my primary technology of choice, although we have also worked on React applications when a client has specifically requested it. I am very familiar with the entire Vue ecosystem (Nuxt, Vuex/Pinia, Vue Router, etc.) and have now worked on several Vue 3 projects and am currently in the process of migrating a large Vue 2 project to Vue 3. I have also focused on user-centric concerns such as accessibility (I was trained as an accessibility auditor), cross-browser compatibility, and UX-focused design.",
  "I am now seeking a new position primarily because I would like to work for a product-focused company that is committed to building a robust, well-maintained product. I am very drawn to the role at Pixieset because your product seems very focused and I believe strongly that a profitable, self-funded company is best aligned to create amazing experiences for its users. You also seem to focus on employee wellness and happiness which I believe is a very sustainable way to run a team!",
  "Thank you for taking your time to consider my application. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss the role."
